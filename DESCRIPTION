Description: A constrained two-dimensional Delaunay triangulation package
  providing both triangulation and generation of voronoi mosaics of 
  irregular spaced data.
  Please note that most of the functions are now also covered in package
  interp, which is a re-implementation from scratch under a free license
  based on a different triangulation algorithm.
