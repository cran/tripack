  abstract =     "TRIPACK is a Fortran 77 software package that employs
                 an incremental algorithm to construct a constrained
                 Delaunay triangulation of a set of points in the plane
                 (nodes). The triangulation covers the convex hull of
                 the nodes but may include polygonal constraint regions
                 whose triangles are distinguishable from those in the
                 remainder of the triangulation. This effectively allows
                 for a nonconvex or multiply connected triangulation
                 (the complement of the union of constraint regions)
                 while retaining the efficiency of searching and
                 updating a convex triangulation. The package provides a
                 wide range of capabilities including an efficient means
                 of updating the triangulation with nodal additions or
                 deletions. For $N$ nodes, the storage requirement is
                 $13N$ integer storage locations in addition to the $2N$
                 nodal coordinates.",
